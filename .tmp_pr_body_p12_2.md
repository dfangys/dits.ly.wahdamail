P12.2: Wire UI to presentation view models (deprecate legacy controllers; no UI change)

Summary
This slice binds UI widgets/screens directly to ViewModels obtained via DI and keeps legacy controllers as thin, deprecated pass-throughs that only emit entry telemetry and delegate orchestration. No UI/UX changes, and kill switch continues to take precedence over feature flags.

Key changes
- Search UI (lib/widgets/search/search.dart):
  - Trigger searches via SearchViewModel.runSearch(controller, requestId) and bind to vm.obx() state. Legacy MailSearchController remains only for input controllers and scroll state.
- Mailbox UI:
  - MailBoxView now obtains MailboxViewModel via DI and calls prefetchOnMailboxOpen(folderId) on build.
  - EnhancedMailboxView and date-group item taps delegate to MailboxViewModel.openMessage(controller: mbc, mailbox, message) for centralized gating; legacy controller fallback preserved.
- Compose UI:
  - ComposeController already delegates send orchestration to ComposeViewModel.send. We now ensure ComposeViewModel is available via DI in redesigned_compose_screen.dart and compose_modal.dart. UI still binds to controller state for fields.
- DI (HomeBinding):
  - Pre-register MailboxViewModel, ComposeViewModel, and SearchViewModel via get_it + Get.put so UI can obtain them directly.
- Docs: ARCHITECTURE.md already marks presentation as active and controllers deprecated in P12.2.

Acceptance checklist
- No UI/UX changes; feature flags remain OFF; kill switch takes precedence.
- UI obtains ViewModels via DI and delegates orchestration to them.
- Legacy controllers remain thin pass-throughs for these flows, with entry telemetry only.
- Gating precedence maintained: kill switch > feature flag > legacy.

Validation output
1) flutter pub get
- Succeeded. Warnings about analyzer version remain unchanged (SDK 3.9 vs analyzer 6.x). No functional impact.

2) dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
- Succeeded in ~27s. Same analyzer-version hint as P12.1.

3) dart run tool/import_enforcer.dart
- Import enforcer: OK

4) dart analyze
- 234 issues found (warnings/info only; no errors). Deprecation infos are expected for controllers and will be removed in P12.3. Zero analyzer errors.

5) flutter test -r expanded
- All tests passed.
- Example excerpts:
  - [telemetry] ddd_route {path: ddd, op: SearchMessages, ...}
  - [telemetry] ddd_route {path: ddd, op: SendEmail, ...}
  - [telemetry] ddd_send_enqueued {path: legacy, status: OutboxStatus.sent}

Notes for reviewers
- Some references to legacy controllers remain in services and tests; these will be addressed in P12.3 when legacy orchestration is removed.
- Deprecation warnings are intentional during P12.2 to guide cleanup.
- Analyzer warnings unrelated to P12 do not block this PR; the acceptance criterion is zero analyzer errors (met).

Follow-ups
- P12.3: Remove legacy controller orchestration and ddd_ui_wiring shim if fully superseded; update docs accordingly; ensure no analyzer errors.
