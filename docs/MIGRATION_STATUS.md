# P31 Migration Status

P31 is complete. The legacy lib/views/** path has been decommissioned and all UI code now lives under lib/features/**/presentation/**.

Summary
- Routes/imports retargeted to feature/presentation paths.
- Guardrails enforced by import_enforcer in CI:
  - Hard-fail: any files under lib/views/**
  - Hard-fail: presentation â†’ services/ or infrastructure/
  - Hard-fail: newly added Colors.* in presentation/views (DS/theme excluded)
- No behavior/UI changes as part of P31.

Quality checks
- dart run tool/import_enforcer.dart passes
- flutter analyze: 0 errors (warnings OK)
- flutter test --no-pub test: PASS

Next
- P19 visual polish to replace remaining raw Colors.* with DS tokens where applicable.
