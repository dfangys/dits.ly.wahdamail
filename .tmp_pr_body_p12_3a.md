Scope
- Remove leftover warnings in presentation layer touched by P12.1/12.2 (no behavior/UI changes).
- Architecture guide updated to reflect active ViewModels; ddd_ui_wiring shim retired in P12.3.
- Pins unchanged: enough_mail 2.1.7; enough_mail_flutter 2.1.1.

Validation
- dart run tool/import_enforcer.dart: OK
- dart analyze: 0 errors (warnings OK)
- flutter test --no-pub test: PASS

Notes
- Base should be main if P12.3 is already merged; otherwise stack on the P12.3 branch.
